                <p style="color: black; font-size: 15px">The 2 and 3 bedroom apartments have been carefully designed to maximize the available space. They are both inspired and sensible. They offer open, spacious living areas with full height and full width thermal glazed windows, expansive balconies, extensive storage in the bedrooms and kitchen, and quality floor ceramics in all areas. Bathroom and kitchen fittings are exceptional, and throughout the apartments, there is plenty of scopes to inject individual personality and style.</p>

                <p style="color: black; font-size: 15px">This project is positioned in a quiet, yet convenient area of Larnaca, ARMONIA is not far from the Foinikoudes promenade with its many bars and restaurants that provide plenty of opportunities to meet friends for a gourmet coffee or sunset cocktail. Here too is the sandy beach that offers water sports and space for sun worshiping.</p>
                <p style="color: black; font-size: 15px">ARMONIA is ideally placed for easy access to supermarkets, shops, schools, and medical facilities. It’s also a place to enjoy the friendly atmosphere of living in a community, then retreat into your private sanctuary as you ponder how beautiful life is.</p>

                <p>NOX is set right in the heart of the next up-market residential and commercial zone adjacent to the new marina and port upgrade which is destined to bring significant wealth and opportunities to the area, Nox offers unparalleled access to all that Larnaca and Cyprus itself have to offer. Overlooking the sea, and a short walk from the Foinikoudes seafront promenade, NOX is convenient for all city services and amenities, and the nearby highway means that Limassol, Nicosia, Paphos, Ayia Napa, and the Troodos mountains are within easy reach. Better still, Nox is just a short distance from Larnaca’s international airport.</p>
