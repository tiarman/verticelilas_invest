        <p >A real estate syndication is where a number of investors pool together their capital to jointly
            purchase a specific real estate project to receive a fixed preferred return as well as a
            predetermined percentage of net profits on the finished project. The investment is made through
            a SPV (single purpose Spanish SL vehicle) that owns the project 100%. Most syndications
            specialize in projects that are low risk but will provide a high return on capital for the syndication
            investors.</p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p>The SPV structure is composed of two key elements, the general partner and the passive investor
            pool.</p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p>The General Partner responsibility is in finding projects that appears to have a strong profit
            potential with low risk. Once a project is identified the general partner will complete a thorough
            due diligence on the properties potential which includes preliminary planning, licensing, sales
            demand, building costs, third party valuation and building a business plan.
            The general partner will also enter negotiations with the seller to get the best price, terms and
            condition for the pending project. Upon completion of the due diligence the General partner will
            then commit their own funds and or arrange funding for the purchase of the property.
            After the purchase the general partners role is to execute the business plan and deliver strong
            returns to the passive investors in the real estate syndication.</p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p>The Passive Real Estate InvestorÂ´s role in the real estate syndication is to provide a portion of the
            capital stack which is needed to finance the project. In exchange, passive investors receive
            participation in the SPV which owns the project a fixed preferred return as well as a
            predetermined percentage of net profits. With the Spanish legal structure the S.L. will be non
            listed as this allows a more flexible system since there are no mandatory statutory rules making
            specific regulations in the bylaws obligatory. Nevertheless, the company is obliged to declare a
            dividend whenever distributable profits exist, unless otherwise provided for in its bylaws.</p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p>As with any investment, nothing is risk-free. When it comes to investing in syndications, the most
            challenging decision a passive investor will make is who they choose to invest with. As an investor,
            you must ensure that you are working with an experienced and trustworthy real estate
            syndication. Another advantage of being a passive investor is that they can spread their capital
            across multiple real estate projects.</p>
