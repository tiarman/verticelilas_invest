        <h1 style="text-align: center">Overview of The Market</h1>
        <div>
            <p>There are an abundance of lucrative opportunities for investment in Cyprus that extend across various sectors, including tourism, shopping, real estate, energy and more. These sectors serve as the foundation of the island’s flourishing economy. Cyprus continues to make prime investments towards expanding other industries, including the filming industry, funds and technological innovation.</p>

            <br/>
            <h1 style="text-align: center">Investing in Cyprus: Advantages & Risks</h1>
            <br>
            <p> Cyprus has rapidly emerged as one of the top destinations that attract foreign investments. In recent years, the island has undergone rapid economic transformations, which has given birth to a sustainable and lucrative corporate ecosystem.</p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <h5>Advantages:</h5>
            <p>Cyprus offers a stable and flourishing economy that is supported by positive forecasts of sustainable growth.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>It attracts businesses with a corporate-friendly and dynamic ecosystem, supported by one of the lowest corporate tax rates across the EU: 12.5%.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The corporate sector is facilitated with a robust transportation and communications infrastructure, while the ports sector offers cost-effective logistics solutions.</p>

            <br/>
            <p>Some of the well-developed sectors of Cyprus include tourism, foreign businesses, maritime transportation and financial services.</p>
            <br/>
            <h5>Risks:</h5>
            <p>The island boosts a population of less than 1 million, which creates a relatively small internal market.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The island also is also weakened by some external debt, associated with bank deposits.</p>
            <br/>

            <p>The influence of the 2009 financial crisis is still visible in the weakness of the Cypriot banking sectors. </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h1 style="text-align: center">Sectors that Power the Cypriot Economy</h1>
        <h5 style="text-align: center">Energy & Renewable Sector</h5>
        <br/>
        <p>Cyprus boosts a rapidly growing and expanding gas and oil sector, which offers a wide array of lucrative opportunities for rapid investment. The Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the island has transformed after the discovery of massive natural gas reserves. The geostrategic location of Cyprus allows for easy access to major transit and communication routes, alongside acting as an integral fuel hub.</p>
        <br/>
        <h5 style="text-align: center">Tourism</h5>
        <br/>
        <p>The tourism and hospitality sector is indeed the most vibrant and dynamic sections of the Cypriot economy. It powers a massive chunk of the country’s GDP as the island is brimming with an abundance of natural beauty and historical fascination. Tourism has rapidly emerged as the most dynamic and sustainable commercial sector, and the island is focused on the development of cultural heritage, rural sites, sports and wedding tourism, among others.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Presently, Cyprus is one of the most lucrative destinations for investment in tourism real estate and infrastructure.</p>
        <br/>
        <h5 style="text-align: center">Real Estate</h5>
        <br/>
        <p>The Cypriot real estate market is one of the most flourishing sectors that boost the island’s economy. The housing market has made a recovery over the years, and sales continue to rise in the wake of increased foreign demand. Foreign residents and expats seek to invest in modern and luxury residential properties across the major cities and scenic destinations of the island.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Luxury villas, coastal residential projects, and high-end apartments have emerged as the major feature of the Cypriot housing market. Foreigners also seek to establish second homes as the island has become a major holiday destination in recent years.</p>

            <h1 style="text-align: center">The Cypriot Real Estate Market</h1>
            <br/>
            <p>The real estate landscape of Cyprus is ripe with investments, and the housing sectors continue to dominate the ecosystem. Under the a lucrative investor citizenship scheme introduced in 2015, Cyprus has welcomed immense growth in its residential real estate sector. In 2018, the residential construction activity on the island increased by a striking 37.7%.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The year 2020 began with astounding growth in the Cypriot construction sector, with burgeoning foreign interest in acquiring properties and planning developments across the island. However, the global pandemic brought a period of stagnation worldwide, and Cyprus had to close its borders, like all responsible nations worldwide. 2021 brought a new wave of developments, and once pandemic restrictions eased, Nicosia was the first real estate markets to spring back into action. In 2021, real estate developments and sales in Nicosia soared to a marked 37% during the first nine months. (Source: Cyprus Profile)</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The real estate industry is a major contributor to the Cypriot economy, and aside from investments, it has also created a wide pool for employment opportunities for the construction and other sectors. In recent years, the island has welcomed an increased demand for high-end apartments, luxury villas, residential complexes and modern neighborhoods. Much of this demand is tied with foreign investment and the tourism industry.</p>
            <br/>
            <h1 style="text-align: center">Purchasing a Property in Cyprus</h1>
            <p>Purchasing a property in Cyprus comes with a wide array of advantages and tax exemptions for local and foreign investors. The economic climate encourages home-ownership, and aside from the sales price, there are several other costs that buyers need to take into account.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>These costs include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Land registry fees</li>
                <li>Local property taxes</li>
                <li>Property transfer fees</li>
                <li>Stamp duties</li>
                <li>Value added tax</li>
                <li>Immovable property taxes</li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
            <p>Other costs that might relate to purchasing include legal fees, real estate agent’s fees, and insurance.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>A report published by the Central Bank of Cyprus earlier this year reveals that property rates in Cyprus have increased steadily during the third quarter of 2021. The report reveals that these increments are driven by the burgeoning demand and rising sales of apartments. 2021 witnessed 0.3% increase in property prices in the first quarter, and 0.5% in the third quarter. The yearly increase is recorded at 1.2%, which is approximately 0.9% higher than the figures recorded in 2020. (Source: Cyprus Mail)</p>

            <h1 style="text-align: center">Renting a Property in Cyprus</h1>
            <p>The island enjoys a diverse and facilitative rental market, and in 2019, rental prices have experienced an increment of 3.4% as demand continues to rise. Rental properties that were constructed before 2000 are subject to the rental control regime that caps rental increments. Rental properties constructed after 2000, are subject to different conditions.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>2021 has witnessed a 1% quarterly increase in the rental rates for apartments, and a 1.7% increment in the rental rates for houses.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The price valuations of these properties is conducted on the basis of the affordability gap, dividend gap, and estimations of home prices justified by the forces of demand and supply in the housing market.</p>

            <h1 style="text-align: center">Selling a Property in Cyprus</h1>
            <p>
                There are various mediums to sell a property in Cyprus. Owners can organize the sale themselves or hire a licensed realtor on a commission basis to organize the sale for them.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                There are countless listing portals and digital platforms that help sellers and agents promote their listings and attract potential buyers from all over the world.

            <h1 style="text-align: center">Selling a Property in Cyprus</h1>
            <p>
                In recent years, the Cyprus construction industry has entered a new age of growth, expansion and development. Countless new projects and developments are being initiated across the island, as Cyprus continues to reform and innovate its construction ecosystem to facilitate construction firms, developers and investors.
                <br/>
                <br/>

                The Cypriot government has made great strides in offering incentives to developers to undertake its mission of the new “Affordable Housing” scheme. The construction industry is expanding and its growth is the result of the increase in increments and support provided to developers. During the months between January and September 2019, a total of 5,201 building permits were authorized, while the construction industry contributed €1.52 billion to the GDP.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The residential sector is expanding at a healthy pace, and in 2019 alone, the number of new home constructions had increased by a whopping 52.6%. Limassol had welcomed the construction of 2,796 homes, 2,070 in Nicosia, 900 in Larnaca and 851 in Paphos.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                If you seek to build, repair, renovate, construct, extend or demolish any building or structure in Cyprus, you will have to obtain the relevant permits from the relevant authorities, including planning and building permits. These are usually carried out by the architect assigned with the drafting of the architectural plans.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                In certain cases, property owners are required to provide specialized studies along with their applications. These include electrological, mechanical, static, and energy performance studies. The authorities will then conduct an on-site inspection of the property and its surrounding area to rule out safety and health hazards. These studies can be carried out by architects or civil engineers assigned for the work.

            <h1 style="text-align: center">Permanent Residency in Cyprus</h1>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Cyprus offers an expedited procedure for the permanent residency to investors from third countries, running parallel to the normal ‘Category F’ immigration permit. In order to apply for this permanent residency scheme, an investment in residential real estate, commercial real estate, company’s shares, or AIFs can be made. A property must in any way be purchased or rented on the island for any investment.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The investment involving a purchase of a residential real estate is probably the most cost effective since the same investment can be used for applying and also as the place of habitation of the applicant. In this case, the applicant can purchase the property alone, with their spouse, or as a Cyprus-based company. The property in question cannot be a resale, it must be a newly constructed property with the Developer as the sole vendor.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The purchase price of the property must be at least €300,000 excluding VAT, and a minimum of €200,000 excluding VAT must be paid in order to apply. The applicant must provide substantial proof of the foreign money transfer of the whole amount, and a contract of sale has to be deposited at the Department of Lands and Surveys.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The applicant will be required to make a bank deposit worth €30,000 in a Cypriot bank, which should be blocked for at least 3 years. The money must be transferred from abroad with substantial proof.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The applicant will also have to provide proof for a secured annual income of €30,000, and an additional €5,000 for each individual dependent on the applicant. These funds must be generated from abroad and not in Cyprus, through legal means, which must be proven, since this residency permit is a non-working permit.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The applicant must provide a clean criminal record for himself, his spouse and children from the age of 16. The criminal record must be from the country of origin, issued no more than 3 months before the application.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h1 style="text-align: center">Work Permits in Cyprus</h1>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Foreign nationals from all over the world can take up employment opportunities in Cyprus, which requires a work permit. Citizens from other European Union member states, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland (EFTA) do not require a work permit.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                A Cyprus work permit can only be obtained if the employer can substantiate that the work opportunity could not have been filled by a local, or an EU/EFTA citizen. Th majority of non-EU foreign nationals find it much easier to find employment in foreign companies operating on the island.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The positions that are eligible for a work permit include:
                <br/><strong>Executive Director:</strong> Annual salary of €41,000, only five foreign executive directors can be hired by a company.
                <br/><strong>Middle Management Staff:</strong> Directors, Mid-level managers, technical and clerical staff. Annual Salary between €21,000 and €40,000.
                <br/><strong>Supporting Staff:</strong> Workers who do not fall under the former categories.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Before applying for the permit, it is important to finalize a contract with the Cypriot firm, as the employer will obtain the permit on behalf of the foreign national. The applicant has to wait for the approval from the Cyprus Department of Labour.
            </p>
            <br/>

            <h1 style="text-align: center">Anti-money laundering</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
            The prevention of money laundering is a regulatory initiative that falls within the sphere of various regulatory bodies, including the Central Bank of Cyprus, the Cyprus Bar Association, the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Cyprus, and the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission.
            <br/>
            <br/>

            The Unit of Combating Money Laundering (MOKAS) is a second-tier regulatory body that is tasked with preventing, investigating and prosecuting incidents of money laundering and terror financing across all industries and sectors. The anti-money laundering regulations of Cyprus are aimed at preventing serious criminal offences, including terror financing, and detecting and prosecuting all such activities to restrain and confiscate illegal funds.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            As per the Cypriot law, money laundering and abetting is a criminal offence, and no individual or entity is allowed to undertake or partake in a one-off transaction without adequate reportage and recordkeeping as per the law. All businesses are obligated to comply with the legalities and regulations to avoid and report money laundering.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h1 style="text-align: center">Corporate Compliance</h1>
        <p>
            Under the Cypriot Commercial Law, all businesses and enterprises are obligated to undertake the corporate compliance regulations. They are obligated to record all the minutes of annual meetings and proceedings amongst the company’s shareholders. These minutes will then be kept at the Cypriot office of the firm.
            <br/>
            If there are any changes within the corporate body of the company, such as removal of executive staff or changes in the firm’s share capital, the firm must inform the Cypriot Trade Register.

        <br/>
        <h1 style="text-align: center">Copyright & patents</h1>
        <p>
            Under the Cypriot regulations, copyrights are generated automatically. As is the case in most countries and in the European Union, there is no process of registering and certifying copyrights in Cyprus. In instances of copyright infringement, there are multiple ways to present evidences for the copyright ownership. In Cyprus, a copyright typically expires 70 years after the death of the author.
            <br/>
            Copyrights are considered movable properties, and they can be transferred in writing. A copyright holder cannot, however, transfer all rights completely. The transfers of the work entirely or in parts is done for a specified time period or for a specified region. The Cypriot law protects the patents granted by the European Patent Organization (EPO) as well as the International Application (PCT), if it is the designated country in the application.
        </p>
        <h1 style="text-align: center">Banking & financial Regulations</h1>
        <p>
            The Cypriot banking sector is divided into two tiers, which include foreign banks and locally-based banks. The international banks have been encouraged to operate in the island to enhance its fiscal regime, and to use Cyprus as a “launch pad” to pursue expansion and target emerging markets.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            There are more than 30 foreign banks and financial institutions operating in Cyprus, which conduct international banking businesses, and do not have much interaction with the local economy. The local banks are involved in the traditional dealings of cash deposits, and lending services to households, businesses and entrepreneurs.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            In Cyprus, banks conduct their operations under the Universal Banking Model, and they offer a wide array of products and services. These funds deposited by the customers serve as primary sources of funding for banks.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The Central Bank of Cyprus regulates all banking platforms and financial institutions on the island, and it is aligned with the European Union regulations and legislation. Over the years, Cyprus has garnered immense praise from international collaborations for introducing firm reforms to boost its financial institutions and ensure greater compliance in the banking sector.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            It is important to note that companies based in Cyprus are not legally obligated to open a bank account in Cyprus, however, it does offer immense convenience. There are more than 40 different domestic and foreign banks operating on the island, and the entire banking system is subject to EC Directives and the regulation of the Central Bank of System, which operates independent of the Constitution as it harmonized with the Eurosystem.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h1 style="text-align: center">Employment Laws</h1>
        <p>All companies operating in Cyprus are subject to the Cyprus employment law, which is a combination of statute law and common law. The employment relationships, statutory rights and obligations are governed by the principles laid down in standard contract law.</p>
        <br/>

        </div>
        <h1 style="text-align: center">Social Insurance</h1>
        <p>
            Employers are required to pay the contributions and the share of the employee by the end of every calendar month. For instance, the contributions for January 2021 have to be paid by the 28th of February 2021. If the last day of the month is a weekend or a public holiday, then the payment must be made on the next working day.
            Individuals who are self-employed are required to pay their contributions on a quarterly basis within a period of one month and ten days.
            <br/> For instance, the contributions for January-March 2021 need to be paid on 10th May, 2021. If the last day of the month is a weekend or a public holiday, the contribution must be paid on the next working day.
            <br/>
            Individuals who are voluntary insured can pay their contributions on a monthly or quarterly basis. If the individual is unable to pay the contributions within a year from the end of the contribution years, he/she will lose the right to voluntary insurance for that specific year.
            In Cyprus, social contributions are measured on the basis of the earnings. For 2021, the maximum earnings levels have witnessed a small increase.
        </p>
        <h1 style="text-align: center">Company directors and roles</h1>
        <p>
            As per the Cypriot legislation’s, each enterprise or company that is limited by shares requires at least one shareholder. Companies and businesses are controlled and overseen by a board of directors. The Cyprus Company Law dictates that a private company based in Cyprus must have at least one director. In other cases, at least two directors are mandatory.
            <br/>
            Under the Cypriot tax legislation, the management and control of an enterprise determines the taxation status of the firm. The secretary of the company is required to maintain the company’s record with the Registrar of Companies, organize and file annual tax returns, and inform of any changes in the directors, shareholders, or share capital, amongst others.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h1 style="text-align: center">Accounting & filing</h1>
        <p>
            As per the Cyprus Companies Law, all Cypriot companies and enterprises are required to prepare their financial statements and records in compliance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). According to these standards, all Cypriot holding companies are required to prepare their consolidated audited financial statements annually. If the company is an intermediary holding company, consolidation will not be required and the superior company in the ownership chain will provide the consolidated financial statements.
            The audited financial statements of the company are prepared to undertake taxation law requirements and they must be provided to the Registrar of Companies.
